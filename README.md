# StealAllTheCats
  This project is an ASP.NET Core Web API that interacts with the "Cats as a Service" (CaaS) API to fetch 25 cat images and store them in a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core. The application allows you to manage and retrieve cat images with their associated tags (temperament) and implement pagination and filtering by tags.
